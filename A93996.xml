         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Strange and VVonderful Relation OF <hi>A Flight of</hi> Piſmires, &amp;c:</head>
            <p>THere are two things which are in this, as all former Ages, worthy of the ſevereſt reproof, and they are <hi>Credulity,</hi> or a too light and eaſie belief on the one hand; and <hi>Incredulity,</hi> when men will not acknowledg or aſſent unto what is reaſonably inferred; and this later too frequently befalls <hi>Wiſe men,</hi> though as <hi>abſurd</hi> as the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Fools, and the credulity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which promiſcuouſly ſwallow any thing. We are not intending to obtrude upon the World any far-fetcht Forraign matter, which a man had much better to believe than to go to prove or to

               <!-- PDF PAGE 4 -->beg your compaſſion from ſome Poetical Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis, but briefly &amp; in the words of truth to give you the Relation of ſome few matters which have by the Atteſtation of many <hi>Credible Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> hapned here within our own World ſince the later end of <hi>July</hi> laſt. The things indeed ſome of them for their matter and circumſtance ſo ſtrange and unheard-of, that I have not met with a Parallell in any Ancient or Modern Inquirer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtrange Accidents of preſent or paſt Times.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Lichfield</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> a place of remark, in its being a Biſhops <hi>See,</hi> on the one and thirtieth day of <hi>July</hi> laſt, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hours of twelve and one a clock, in the time of a full Market, (that being a market-day there) on a ſuddain there appeared an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Swarm of <hi>Piſmires</hi> or <hi>Ants</hi> with wings, which by their cloſe keeping in a body, therewith and with their wings clouded and made dark the Skye; So many of them ſetled together in the <hi>Market-Place,</hi> and in ſeveral other <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> that the ground was covered, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154078:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 4 -->market-people ſo annoyed, that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to break up and be gone ſooner by far then they uſed to do; for by <hi>Three of the Clock in the Afternoon the whole Market was diſſolved:</hi> both <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Horſes</hi> ſo grievouſly ſtung and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented therewith, that they were forced to make what eſcape they could from them: Some <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> through the torment of their ſtinging ran up and down more like wilde <hi>Creatures,</hi> than ſuch as had been accuſtomed to the Saddle or burdens. Several of the Workmen that were imployed about the repair of <hi>Lichfield Minſter,</hi> were ſtung with them: And the <hi>People</hi> that were at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, Work in the Fields, were forced to leave their buſineſſe. After their continuance in this manner for three or four hours, or more, many of them fell down dead both in the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but eſpecially in the <hi>Streets</hi> in ſuch prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quantities, that the <hi>Horſes</hi> Hoofs were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over treading among them: and not much leſſe number in the houſes, ſo that the People were compelled to ſweep them out together; which being by that means brought together, made ſeveral heaps of them, to the bigneſſe of a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154078:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 5 -->buſhell of Corn or larger; They were judged by ſeverall of thoſe that ſaw them, to have come out of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> At length, the living remainder of them, which was not ſmall, took their Flight to the Towns-end towards the <hi>North,</hi> where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding themſelves, as it were, into two bodies, they parted, ſome of them flying one way, ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet notwithſtanding left both their terrour and marks behind them among the People, who at the ſtrangeneſſe of the Prodigy were ſo much affrighted, that they knew not what to ſay or do, but very much admired the ſtrangeneſſe of the thing. Theſe <hi>Piſmires</hi> or <hi>Ants</hi> were not like thoſe that are commonly found in <hi>Mole-hills,</hi> but a great deal bigger; they were judged to be about the bigneſſe of a Spider.</p>
            <p>The like thing about the ſame time happened (with ſome ſmall varying circumſtances) about the City of <hi>Coventry</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> twenty miles from <hi>Lichfield,</hi> where multitudes of them fell, and in ſeveral other places; but we need not run over the Particulars anew, to trouble the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> twice with one thing.</p>
